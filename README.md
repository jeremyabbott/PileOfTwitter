# ðŸ’© TWIT

This is a browser extension (only tested on Firefox) that will let you quickly tell who on twitter is a dick or not.

Our advanced AI based blockchain technology will annotate twitter users' names with poo emojis (ðŸ’©) if their ShitScore&trade; is deemed shitty.  Our algorithms are based off the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms.


# TODO

- Cache user score so if they appear multiple times, we don't have to recalculate score.
  - Base user name on handle.
  - After certain time, do recalculate.
- Test more complex scoring algorithms.
- Write tests.
- Properly handle quote tweets and promotional tweets.
