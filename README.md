# ðŸ’© TWIT

This is a browser extension (only tested on Firefox) that will let you quickly tell who on twitter is a dick or not.

Our advanced AI based blockchain technology will annotate twitter users' names with poo emojis (ðŸ’©) if their ShitScore&trade; is deemed shitty.  Our algorithms are based off the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms.


# TODO

- Better Cache
  - Store cache in cookie (or something, idk) so its persistent for the user
  - Invalidate cache after certain time
- Test more complex scoring algorithms (duh sentiment analysis 101).
- Write tests (mocha, wtf, idk).
- Properly handle quote tweets and promotional tweets.
- Work on user page (only tested on timeline right now).
